Nicode is an application for helping cigarette consumers stop smoking or reduce smoking with the concept of motivation through rewards, community, and recommendation.

The application works with the watch that records the statistics of smoking per day. It'll save the statistics via BLUETOOTH, show the statistics and progress from the watch as a challenge system to encourage users to be more interested and fun, and show how many times users smoke. The fewer smoking times per day, the more coins users get. The user can use the coins to redeem rewards like discount coupons and donations. There's a community system for users to exchange tips or great recommendations for stopping smoking, taking care of themselves, and cheering each other up.

This project passed two rounds into the final last 10 teams round of the Prime Ministerâ€™s Award for Health Promotion Innovation 2021.
